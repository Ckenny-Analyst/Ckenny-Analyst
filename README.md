## ðŸ”¹ About Me  

I am a detail-oriented Data Entry Specialist and aspiring Data Analyst with a deep-seated passion for data integrity. My journey started with a simple frustration: seeing how a small error at the source could compromise an entire analysis.

That's why I specialize in turning raw, messy data into accurate and actionable insights. With hands-on experience in Excel, Power BI, and SQL, I help businesses build a solid data foundation they can truly trust and use for decision-making.

My projects have focused on solving real-world problems and proving the value of clean data. Some of my key skills include:

 -	Over 90% accuracy in handling large datasets
